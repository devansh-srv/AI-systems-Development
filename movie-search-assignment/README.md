# Movie Semantic Search Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the semantic search on movie plots assignment. The project implements semantic search functionality using sentence transformers to find movies based on plot similarity.

## Project Overview

This project uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model to encode movie plots into embeddings and perform semantic search using cosine similarity. The solution allows users to search for movies using natural language queries that are matched against plot descriptions.
